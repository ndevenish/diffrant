Generate a vite/react/typescript project. The purpose of the project is
to create a react component called "diffrant". This will be an image
viewer for viewing diffraction images (all grayscale, 8/16/32 bit).

There are sample data in public/data/se_thau_10_1_00001.{json,png}. The
json should be treated as an endpoint to load metadata about the image.
The png image is one of the example images; in reality these will be
dynamic endpoints. The sample image is png, but the handling should be
abstracted to the point that it can accomodate different image
decompression formats in the future (e.g. a raw image dump with the size
data in the metadata endpoint).

The input to the component should be the two endpoints for metadata and
image, an image "number" that is intended to choose from multi-image
formats (will be relevant later) and a viewer state object, which can
be updated from within the component.

The component itself: It should be split into image, left, and a controls
panel on the right. By default, the whole image should be displayed, but
the user can drag/pan/zoom the image to inspect the data more thorougly.
The pixel data should always show nearest-neighbor, no filtering on zoom,
but on zooming out to smaller sizes should have a choice of resolution
(e.g. average, max pixel over combined area). By default, masked pixels
should show as background; for now, masked = "above trusted range from
metadata" but eventually we will load a separate mask layer.

The panel on the right should have several controls; the most important
of which is a draggable histogram of the image data, that can be used to
affect the exposure for calculation of image brightness. Also on the
toolbar, a "colour scheme" selector that allows normal (0=white),
inverse (0=black) and other relevant colour schemes.

At some point in the future, we will want to be able to render "numbers"
on each pixel block when zoomed all the way in, allowing the user to
directly read off the value. But we don't need to implement that yet -
this eventual use case should factor into the technology choice.
